1. It was not so clear what does: 'Your solution should include an API' mean, its a REST implementations or open api itself.
2. Have different thoughts about adding movie rating, it also was not so clear, I implemented out application rating, 
but it also was a case to extend the existing ones and compete it and save from our side.
3. I was sitting on the fancy deciding how and when I should populate DB using a CSV file. 
The first time I created an endpoint for it then decided to use Spring Lifecycle to set it automatically and not put it on the user, 
however, it also has a disadvantage - the possibility of duplicate data.
